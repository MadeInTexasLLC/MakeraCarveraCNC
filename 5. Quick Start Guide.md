# Quick Start Guide to Carvera CNC with Fusion360

## ASSUMPTIONS

### This How-To assumes that the Carvera CNC and Fusion360 is your first introduction to subtractive manufacturing and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software, respectively.

### This How-To also assumes that you have basic Computer Aided Design (CAD) experience. Whether if it's from a formal class or informal hobbyist 3D printing, this guide assumes that you have done an extrude before, so we won't be going over that. 

### This guide is focused on bringing your CAD 3D model into Fusion60 CAM to be carved by the Carvera.
  
#### Aside from that, **no information will be left out, and you won't be left behind!**  

## STEP #1: EQUIPMENT  
1. Carvera CNC (this guide could likely also be used for the Carvera Air, but it has not been formally tested on that model, yet).
2. Personal Computer (PC)
3. **optional* 3D-Printer

## STEP #2: BASIC WORKFLOW  
There are three general steps to any subtractive manufacturing proejct:
#### 1. Preparation Passes
These are the cuts that you would make to prepare a piece of stock before the actual forming passes. Some of these passes include:  
- **Surfacing passes**: cuts that flatten the surface of a piece of stock.
- **Alignment Pin passes**: cuts that bore out holes on the stock to insert dowel pins into that orient the stock onto the workbed/jig.
#### 2. Roughing Passes  
These are cuts that remove as much of the material as *efficiently* as possible. This includes efficiency in:  
- **Speed**: cutting off as much material as fast as possible. Speed is dependant on the power of your spindle and the rigidity of your machine. The Carvera is NOT a rigid machine, and I've had the bit fall out of the collet numerous times. Speed and feed optimization is essential!
- **Bit Engagement**: for example, using the full length of the bit to ensure even wear on all parts of the bit to extend life.
#### 3. Finishing Passes  
These are the detailing cuts that focus on... well... the details. 

### SUMMARY
These are the major steps that you should start thinking about before you go into CAM. Here are the flow of questions that I typically ask myself as a elf-taught hobbyist:  
1. How do I hold the stock down?  
- Will I use adhesives? Physical hold-downs? A vacuum table? Magnets? All of the above? You can get a better answer for this in the "Workpiece Holding Guide" in this repository.  
2. How do I orient the stock accurately?  
- Will I use alignment pins? A straight-edge?  
3. How do I set the work origin of the stock?  
- This will determine if I get dimensionally accurate cuts on multiple pieces.  
4. What bits do I have for *roughing* passes?  
- What is the largest bit that I have/can buy? This depends on the size of my collet, spindle power, and rigidity of machine.
5. What speeds and feeds can my machine and roughing bit handle?
- Optimizing this part will require emipirical testing/tweaking.
6. What bits do I have for *finishing* passes?
7. What speeds and feeds can my machine and finishing bit handle?
