# Workpiece Holding Guide - Comparison of Glues and Tapes (*WIP)

## There are many ways to hold down your work piece. 
## Which is the right way for you?

## TLDR: MY RECCOMENDATIONS
#### For **absolute beginners** (*who don't care too much as dimensional accuracy*) **who have the Carvera** (*with the auto bed leveling Z probe*), I would recommend buying:  
### A cordless hot glue gun with high temperature glue sticks  

- Hot glue applies and dries very quickly, allowing you to rapidly prototype/manufacture one piece after another.  
- The auto bed leveling of the Carvera accounts for the inconsistencies in the drying of the glue (areas that are applied first will dry faster and be thicker than areas that are applied last).  
- Hot glue is inexpensive and a cordless hot glue gun would make application more convienent (and cooler looking). 
- High temperature hot glue worked very well in keeping my pieces secure and I had no trouble using it to cut out 20 Wooden Serving Plates for a local restaurant (see BrothAndBasil repository). I used a 1/4" bit cutting softwood and the rigidity of the machine gave out first (the bit fell out of the collet) and the workpiece stayed put. 
- High temperature (NOT low temperaturea) hot glue was rigid enough to hold down the piece, but was very easy to remove after the piece was finished.
- Hot glue can be peeled off from the stock and bed, forgoing the need to buy/apply masking tape to protect either surface.

#### For **absolute beginners** (*who don't care too much as dimensional accuracy*) **who DO NOT have the Carvera** (*with the auto bed leveling Z probe*), I would recoomend buying:  
### Masking tape and Gorilla wood glue  

- A CNC that cannot auto bed level needs to have the stock as flat as possible to the bed. Gorilla wood glue has a low viscosity and can do this reasonably well for beginners.

#### For **ANYONE** that requires high dimensional accuracy, speed, and reliability; I would reccomend buying:
### Masking tape and quick drying super glue  

- Super glue dries quicker and stronger than Gorilla wood glue, but is much more expensive. I would reccomend this combination to anyone that is producing products for paying customers.  
## WORKHOLDING BASICS
The [Masking Tape and Glue Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-coDYZCmEw) is essentially the go-to method to hold down a workpiece when physical hold downs are not available. 

Here are my experiences with various options and my reccomendations for each:

**TAPE**  
1. Scotch Masking Tape vs. Amazon Basics Masking Tape  
- I would reccomend buying name brand Scotch Tape. Their non-adhesive backing seems to be more porous and less "shiny" which allows for stronger and quicker application of glue/liquid adhesive. Additionally, the tape itself has stronger adhesion and the cost savings for buying the Amazon Basics Masking Tape is negligible.  
  
**HONORABLE MENTION**: Double-Sided Tape
- This is a convienent way to hold your workpiece, but it is not the most accurate or cost-efficient. Additionally, depending on the tape brand you buy, the double-sided tape may leave a residue that would have to be removed during post-processing.

**GLUE**
1. Loctite Super Glue: Quick-drying (<5 minutes), most expensive (comparatively), reliable
2.  Gorilla Wood Glue: Medium-drying (~30-45 minutes), second most expensive, mostly reliable
3. Elmer's School Glue: Slow-drying (~24 hours), least expensive, semi-reliable (if fully cured)
4. Gorilla Glue Sticks (High Temperature): Quick-drying (<5 minutes), second least expensive, reliable

Here is a cheat sheet on how to use the [Masking Tape and Glue Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-coDYZCmEw):  
- Step #1: Place masking tape to the back of your stock and to the bed of the Carvera.
- Step #2: Place your chosen glue to top of the masking tape of the bed.
- Step #3: Align the masking tape placed on the stock to the masking tape placed on the bed, and then sandwich the glue between the two.

**PHYSICAL HOLD DOWNS**  
For many cases, physical hold downs are the most inexpensive (long-term) and tried-and-true form of workholding. Below are some of the possible options.  
  
**NOTE**: The Carvera does not come with some of these methods, but I am currently working on ways to modify the original Carvera machine to include some of these hold down options:

1. Clamps
2. Vice grip
3. Magnets
4. Vacuum Table
