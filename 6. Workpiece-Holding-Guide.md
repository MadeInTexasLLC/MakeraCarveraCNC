# Workpiece Holding Guide - Comparison of Glues and Tapes (*WIP)

## There are many ways to hold down your work piece. 
## Which is the right way for you?

## TLDR: MY RECCOMENDATIONS
For **absolute beginners** (*who don't care too much as dimensional accuracy*) **who have the Carvera** (*with the auto bed leveling Z probe*), I would recoomend buying:  
### A cordless hot glue gun with high temperature glue sticks  

- Hot glue applies and dries very quickly, allowing you to rapidly prototype/manufacture one piece after another.  
- The auto bed leveling of the Carvera accounts for the inconsistencies in the drying of the glue (areas that are applied first will dry faster and be thicker than areas that are applied last).  
- Hot glue is inexpensive and a cordless hot glue gun would make application more convienent (and cooler looking). 
- High temperature hot glue worked very well in keeping my pieces secure and I had no trouble using it to cut out 20 Wooden Serving Plates for a local restaurant (see BrothAndBasil repository).  
- High temperature (NOT low temperaturea) hot glue was rigid enough to hold down the piece, but was very easy to remove after the piece was finished.
- Hot glue can be peeled off from the stock and bed, forgoing the need to buy/apply masking tape to protect either surface.

For **absolute beginners** (*who don't care too much as dimensional accuracy*) **who DO NOT have the Carvera** (*with the auto bed leveling Z probe*), I would recoomend buying:  
### Masking tape and Gorilla wood glue  

- A CNC that cannot auto bed level needs to have the stock as flat as possible to the bed. Gorilla wood glue has a low viscosity and can do this reasonably well for beginners.

For **ANYONE** that requires high dimensional accuracy, speed, and reliability; I would reccomend buying:
### Masking tape and quick drying super glue  

- Super glue dries quicker and stronger than Gorilla wood glue, but is much more expensive. I would reccomend this combination to anyone that is producing products for paying customers.  
  
  
  
  

## WORKHOLDING BASICS

Tape
Summary: I would reccomend buying the Beige Scotch Tape. Their non-adhesive backing seems to be more porous and less "shiny" which give the impression (and anecdotal report) that it allows for better adhesion to all of the tested liquid adhesives.

- Blue Amazon Basics Tape
- Double-sided tape

Glue
Summary: For general purpose and non-strict tolerance projects, I would reccomend Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks. While this does not result in the flatest bed adhesion, the Carvera Auto Bed Leveling compensates for this enough to result in even final passes. For projects that require precision or are very agressive with cuts, I would reccomend using Loctite Super Glue. That being said, I have used Gorilla Hot Glue Sticks with a 1/4" bit and the rgidity of the machine gave out first before the glue. That is why I am confident in saying that the Gorilla Hot Glue sticks are more than enough for the Carvera specifically.

- Step #3a: Place masking tape to the back of your stock and to the bed of the Carvera.
- Step #3b: Place your chosen glue to top of the masking tape of the bed.
- Step #3c: Align the masking tape placed on the stock to the masking tape placed on the bed, and then sandwich the glue between the two.
